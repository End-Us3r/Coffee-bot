# Coffee-bot

This is a Coffee Chatbot program which greets the user and takes their order.

The program defines several functions to collect information about the user's coffee order, including the size of the drink, the type of drink (brewed coffee, mocha, or latte), and the type of milk (for a latte).

The program prints out a confirmation message with the user's name and the details of their order. If the user enters an invalid input at any point, the program will prompt the user to try again until valid input is received.

The main function, coffee_bot(), calls the other functions in the correct order to take the user's order and print out the confirmation message.
