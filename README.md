Make a simple markdown file for my readme file with the following code: #Practice Project-Carly's Clippers
#10/23/2022

hairstyles = ["bouffant", "pixie", "dreadlocks", "crew", "bowl", "bob", "mohawk", "flattop"]

prices = [30, 25, 40, 20, 20, 35, 50, 35]

last_week = [2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 4, 6, 2]

total_price = 0

#Sums the total price of haircuts
for price in prices:
total_price += price

#Average price of a haircut
average_price = total_price / len(prices)
print("Average Haircut Price: " + str(average_price))

#Takes current prices in prices list and reduces by 5
new_prices = [price - 5 for price in prices]
print(new_prices)

total_revenue = 0
#Sums up total profit for last weeks haircuts
for i in range(len(hairstyles)):
total_revenue += prices[i] * last_week[i]
print("Total Revenue: " + str(total_revenue))
#Average daily profit
average_daily_revenue = total_revenue / 7
print("Total Daily Revenue: " + str(average_daily_revenue))

#Makes list out of haircuts that are less than 30
cuts_under_30 = [hairstyles[i] for i in range(len(new_prices)) if new_prices[i] < 30]
print(cuts_under_30)

This Python script calculates various metrics related to Carly's Clippers, including average haircut price, adjusted prices, total revenue, average daily revenue, and a list of haircuts priced under $30.

Feel free to use this Markdown template for your README.md file! Adjust formatting or add more sections as needed.

What is the correct file extension for a markdown file or is ok to use the readme file?
ChatGPT

The correct file extension for a Markdown file is .md. Therefore, for your readme file, the appropriate file name would be README.md.

Using .md extension is widely recognized and supported by various tools and platforms (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) for rendering Markdown content properly formatted. While some platforms might also recognize README.txt or other variations, README.md is the standard and recommended convention. This ensures that Markdown syntax highlighting and rendering are applied correctly when viewed on different platforms or in different Markdown editors.

coffee_bot()

This Python script implements a simple coffee ordering chatbot. It prompts the user for the size and type of drink they want, handles different drink options including latte with milk choices, and concludes by taking the user's name and confirming the order. Adjustments or additions can be made to the Markdown format as needed for your README.md file.
